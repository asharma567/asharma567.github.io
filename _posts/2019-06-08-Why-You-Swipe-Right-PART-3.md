# More on racial discrimination: the users or the apps?

The disparate racial proportions encountered during my two months of Tinder swiping indicate that Tinder‚Äôs matching algorithm isn‚Äôt as unbiased as they‚Äôd like to believe. That algorithm is ultimately what dictates anyone‚Äôs chances of a match occurring, and, at the time of this research, it‚Äôs showing me people who are mostly Caucasian. 

I can‚Äôt swipe on someone of a different ethnicity if I‚Äôm not being shown any people of that ethnicity at all! Which made me wonder: how often is my profile getting seen? What‚Äôs my [desirability ranking](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054871/whats-your-tinder-score-inside-the-apps-internal-ranking-system), according to the Tinder gods? 

Mobile dating apps that allow users to filter their searches by race‚Äîor that rely on algorithms that pair up people of the same race‚Äîreinforce racial divisions and biases, according to a [new paper](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/09/redesign-dating-apps-lessen-racial-bias-study-recommends) by Cornell researchers. As self-thinking machine learning products become a habitual part of our lives, the average person might not even question their results and just unconsciously perpetuate this cycle.

Dating apps thus have a responsibility to their users to implement fairness policies. In this case, Tinder‚Äôs matching algorithm should‚Äôve been trained on a balanced dataset of ethnicities. Though I can‚Äôt be entirely sure, I don‚Äôt believe Tinder worked to balance the ethnicities for their matching algorithm. Perhaps they should consider a less racially-biased redesign.

The lopsided racial proportions here are reminiscent of another world heavily influenced by racial biases: fashion modeling. Sadly, fashion is another case in which the majority makes the rules. Cameron Russell discusses this in her famous [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_russell_looks_aren_t_everything_believe_me_i_m_a_model/discussion?wmode=opaque):


    _‚ÄúWell, for the past few centuries, we have defined beauty not just as the health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin... In 2007, when an inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway, of the 677 models hired, only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white.‚Äù_

Yuval Noah Harari, a renowned historian, also echoes this in his bestseller _[Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ICN066A/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)_:


    _‚ÄúAmerican aesthetic culture was built around a white standard of beauty. The physical attributes of the white race‚Äîfor example, light skin, fair and straight hair, a small upturned nose‚Äîcame to be identified as beauty.‚Äù_

And Hugh Hefner blatantly popularized these preferences in Playboy magazine. He openly admitted to favoring blondes: ‚ÄúI would have loved to [date Marilyn Monroe]. I‚Äôm a sucker for blondes and she is the ultimate blonde,‚Äù [he told CBS Los Angeles in 2012](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2012/08/03/hugh-hefner-talks-about-his-memories-of-marilyn-monroe/). 

In an [interview with the LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/la-oe-morrison-new9-2009may09-column.html), Heffner recalled that seeing [Alice Faye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Faye) in films as a child was the moment that first fixed in his mind the specific ideals of beauty‚Äîbusty and blonde‚Äîthat he'd later made ubiquitous. This construct became pervasive in large part because of the personal biases of someone who had broad media outreach.

So if Caucasian features are favored in these contexts, are dating algorithms haphazardly doing the same thing as modeling scouts?

Let‚Äôs look at the big picture: dating apps are constantly showing people from the same demographic, and the media has been parading these same people around for centuries in magazines, billboards, and art. Anyone who‚Äôs heard of the [mere exposure effect](https://www.psychreg.org/mere-exposure-effect/) knows that when this occurs, we end up liking the things we‚Äôre most exposed to. 

It should be clear why fairness policies need to be enforced; what about a platform which promotes diversity? Now that would be something. 

Unfortunately, most apps go the other way‚Äîfully segmented, like Dil Mil, JDate, Christian Mingle, Minder, etc. (At least they‚Äôre upfront about it.) Sure, there are niche groups who only want to date their own kind but there‚Äôs nothing similar to [‚ÄúUnited Colors of Benetton‚Äù](https://us.benetton.com/) in the dating app world.


# Redesigning dating

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only person who‚Äôs met up with someone I matched with online, only to find that I wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to them‚Ä¶ even though we got along well prior to meeting face-to-face. 

If dating apps had a way to extract physical attributes from photos and combine them with personality data, they‚Äôd have much more success in creating couples. For example, OKCupid could pair the info gleaned from all those questions it asks users along with data about their physical attributes from swiping activity. 

Better yet, what if no one had to fill out any lengthy, tedious questionnaires and instead, computer vision was used to infer more about personality? If an app could infer the activities you‚Äôre interested in from an activity-based photo (such as a pic of you surfing or doing yoga), maybe they could link people together based on the overlap of their favorite activities. Since it‚Äôs common to have access to a user‚Äôs Instagram feed, this should be even easier for an app to do and require minimal effort on the user‚Äôs part. 

Tinder is moving in this direction with [Top Picks](https://blog.gotinder.com/introducing-picks-now-on-tinder/), where it‚Äôs [extracting info from user photos](https://www.swipehelper.com/2019/03/24/tinder-using-amazon-aws-image-recognition-not-the-way-you-thought/) and bios to make personalized recommendations. But I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre using Instagram or Facebook photos yet, which is important because with these systems, typically, the more data, the better the recommendations. 

Individual user insights are another feature worth digging deeper into: as Eckhart Tolle tells us, ‚ÄúAwareness is the greatest agent for change.‚Äù Like I mentioned before, there are often conflicts that occur between our conscious and unconscious brain‚Äîfor example, you answered that you‚Äôre serious about dating someone of the same religion or race as you on your questionnaire, but your swiping activity indicates otherwise. Which is accurate? 

And then there‚Äôs the big question: who‚Äôs attracted to _you?_ What do the people swiping right on you have in common, both physiologically and psychologically? Do they all do yoga? Have an Ivy League pedigree? Have a dog or a cat? 

Could there be an algorithmic tool developed that can identify your specific demographic even if you‚Äôre unaware that you belong to one? 

Without being aware of your demographic, you‚Äôll always have friction dating other people, says self-help/dating guru Mark Manson. He covers the concept thoroughly in his book _[Models](https://markmanson.net/books/models)_. 

This might be the most enlightening bit of insight for a person looking for love. People looking for answers to their dating struggles often blame things which aren‚Äôt relevant. Using the user insights described above, they‚Äôll be able to pinpoint the source of their woes much more accurately.

Lastly, if apps put more stock in swiping activity at a personal level and if users were aware of this, maybe users would swipe with more care (just like I did, as I didn‚Äôt want to pollute the results of this study). That way, apps wouldn‚Äôt have to do things like [limit users on how many times they can swipe](https://blog.photofeeler.com/tinder-swipe-limit/) in a given day. I‚Äôm positive this would result in a higher quality of matches.


# What have I learned? What should you take away from all this?

Over the course of my analysis, I learned which facial features I find most attractive. This was was validated by my dating history‚ÄîI had no idea I had such a bias towards women with sharp features.

It seems there‚Äôs no need for me to feel glum if online dating isn‚Äôt working out: the real world doesn‚Äôt mirror the algorithmic one online. The racial bias present in the online dating world is likely not a realistic reflection of user discretion but rather the matching algorithm‚Äôs weakness. 

Dating apps have a responsibility to be aware of fairness practices and to level out the playing field, especially given their ever-rising popularity. This, combined with the lack of user-level insights and questionable algorithmic fairness, indicates that a redesign is long overdue.

Most importantly, through rigorously applying myself during this analysis, I‚Äôve learned a lot about the science of attraction. It's part nature and part nurture, which means we can make changes if we don‚Äôt consciously agree with our inherent biases. 

We often get caught up in arbitrary societal norms, herd mentality, and the celebration of the fortunate few whose looks are constantly paraded around us, and are subsequently brainwashed to believe those select features alone are attractive. Recognizing this tendency for the social conditioning gives me more to think about when I find myself judging a potential match solely based on looks‚Äîmaybe there‚Äôs more to it than that.

_And here‚Äôs where we wrap things up! I hope you enjoyed this series‚ÄîI really poured my heart into it (in more ways than one _üôÇ_). _

_Let me know in the comments if your experience with online dating lines up with my findings, or if you‚Äôve got some additional insight to share!_
